## What it Provides

Tiddly-dark-desktop is an all-in-one application that runs [Tiddlywiki Server Edition](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Installing%20TiddlyWiki%20on%20Node.js) with some pre-installed plugins focussed on programmers notes.

## Installation

1. Download a binary suitable for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/ahanniga/tiddly-dark-desktop/releases/) page.
2. Unzip the file into a directory
3. Run the executable
4. On first run the default Tiddlers are copied to the user home directory under `~/.tiddly-dark`

## Can I Still Open It in a Browser?
Yes, while the desktop app is running the wiki can still be accessed from http://localhost:23981 and tiddlers will sync between the two.
